Enter your name and a prompt to generate your image. If you are stuck and don't know what you would like your prompt to be, click ![Surprise me](./client/public/images/surprise-me-button.jpg) to get a random prompt from our selection of 50 pre-made prompts. Once you are happy with your prompt, click ![Generate](./client/public/images/generate-button.jpg). DALL-E AI will then generate an image for you.
